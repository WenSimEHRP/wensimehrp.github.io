This site is where I share my random thoughts.

## Future Plans

So here are my plans:

- Tranport Journal
- Random typst snippets and/or projects
- ding ding dang dangs
- Translation stuff

When I get out of high school
I would add more stuff to this site. My resume perhaps.

and I am still in high school.
