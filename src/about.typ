= Future Plans

So here are my plans:

- Transport Journal
- Random typst snippets and/or projects
- ding ding dang dangs
- Translation stuff

When I get out of high school I would add more stuff to this site. My resume perhaps.

= About me

The person behind this site is still in high school, so don't expect him to be responsive
nor to be professional. He's also terrible at math.
#footnote[
  I mean, I did get a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam, but that does not mean I am capable
  of doing math... I did it last year, and this year I forgot almost everything about
  calculus.

= Technologies

This site uses these technologies:

#table(
  columns: 2,
  [Eleventy], [static site generation],
  [Tailwind CSS], [styling],
  [Typst], [typesetting articles],
  [WebC], [web components],
  [GitHub Pages], [hosting],
)

= Contact

You can reach me at #elink("mailto:wensimehrp@gmail.com")[my email]. You can also
find me on #elink("https://matrix.to/#/@wensimehrp:matrix.org")[Matrix].
