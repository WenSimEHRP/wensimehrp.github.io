= About the Name

I had several names in mind for this site, like "WenSim's Blog", "WSIM", and a lot
more I won't even mention because they're too embarrassing. I eventually named it
"The Gao Log". So,

- Gao is my surname.
- Go and observe.
- Gather and optimize.
- Lots of other acronyms that can be made with GAO.

And idk but Gao-games? So the games I play automatically become galgames???

Alright, that was not very funny.

= Future Plans

So here are my plans:

- Transport Journal
- Random typst snippets and/or projects
- ding ding dang dangs
- Translation stuff

When I get out of high school I would add more stuff to this site. My resume perhaps.

= About Me

The person behind this site is still in high school, so don't expect him to be responsive
nor to be professional. He's also terrible at math.
#footnote[
  I mean, I did get a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam, but that does not mean I am capable
  of doing math... I did it last year, and this year I forgot almost everything about
  calculus.
]

And my English sucks, like, for real.

= Technologies

This site uses these technologies:

#table(
  columns: 2,
  table.header[Technology][Usage],
  [Eleventy], [static site generation],
  [Tailwind CSS], [styling],
  [Typst], [typesetting articles],
  [WebC], [web components],
  [GitHub Pages], [hosting],
)
